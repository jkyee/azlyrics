				<!-- Lyrics -->
				<pre class="song-lyrics">
					I need a Cha Cha beat, boy

					I can only do right by yuh
					I won't never go deceive yuh
					I'll even dye my hair blonde for yuh
					I can be your Justin Bieber
					Give me that work like you RiRi
					Girl, pop it like 3D
					Grant wishes like genies
					Oh let me see that ting baby

					Trust in me
					This is the moment you've been waiting for girl, all your life
					Tell your friends that you don't need a ride home
					Cause I got you tonight
					The Uber's on the way cause I had a couple drinks tonight
					But I'm more drunk off of your love
					Baby, I just can't get enough
					So baby girl

					Wake up, wake up, let's get it started
					Stay up, stay up girl, I'd be on it
					Don't go to bed unless you go with me
					Phone blowin' up, I'ma let the hotline bling

					Baby me like yuh
					I'll make you feel so good
					Do you just like I should
					(I hope you know it
					I hope you know it)

					The way you workin' that motion
					Girl, you got me in a trance
					It's like I'm crossing the ocean
					Journey to another land, oh no no
					Bae you are the fittest and oh no no
					Ooh, you're pullin' on my pants, oh no no
					I wanna rock your, rock your body
					Girl, you got me so excited

					Trust in me
					This is the moment I've been waiting for, girl, all my life
					I have no other intentions, only just to go and do you right
					Baby surf the waves together in the moment of our lives
					It's an unforgettable love
					Baby I just can't get enough

					Wake up, wake up, let's get it started
					Stay up, stay up girl, I'd be on it
					Don't go to bed unless you go with me
					Phone blowin' up, I'ma let the hotline bling

					Baby me like yuh
					I'll make you feel so good
					Do you just like I should
					(I hope you know it
					I hope you know it)

					Baby, look into my eyes
					We inside your paradise, baby
					Paradise
					Feel the breeze up on your skin
					Capture this so it'll never end
					Never end

					Baby me like yuh
					I'll make you feel so good
					Do you just like I should

					Baby me like yuh
					I'll make you feel so good
					Do you just like I should
					(I hope you know it
					I hope you know it)
