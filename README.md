This project redesigns the UI/UX to the website https://www.azlyrics.com/
using html and css. It works best full screen as modifying the browser size was
not specifically implemented. The home page is the only page that allows interaction
through the "search" button, the "submit lyrics" button, and the albums listed
under the "what's hot" section.
