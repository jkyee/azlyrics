This project redesigns the UI/UX to the website https://www.azlyrics.com/
using html and css. It works best full screen, as modifying the browser size was
not specifically implemented. The home page is the only page that allows interactive
links to other pages through the "Search" button, the "Submit Lyrics" button, and
the albums listed under the "What's Hot" section.
